# Update Panel in asp.net
- The UpdatePanel control is a container control and derives from the Control class. 
- It acts as a container for the child controls within it and does not have its own interface.
- When a control inside it triggers a post back, the UpdatePanel intervenes to initiate the post asynchronously and update just that portion of the page.<br>
