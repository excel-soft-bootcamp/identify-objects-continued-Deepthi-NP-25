|ASP.net MVC|ASP.net core MVC|
|-----------|----------------|
|ASP.NET MVC will allow us to choose MVC or Web API or both while creating a web application|ASP.NET core MVC does not allow us to choose Web API in the MVC project while creating a web application|
|This is because the web stack for MVC 5 and Web API are different|ASP.NET Core MVC has a single-aligned web stack for MVC and Web API|
| In ASP.net MVC for dependency injection we use separate DI containers like Unity|In ASP.net core MVC dependency injection is inbuilt|
